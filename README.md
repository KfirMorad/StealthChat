## Discord Server & Bot Setup

1. **Create a Discord Server** (or use an existing one).
2. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Create a new application and add a **bot** to it.
4. Under \"Bot\" settings:
   - Enable **Message Content Intent**
   - Enable **Server Members Intent**
   - Copy the **Bot Token** (use it in `.env`)
5. Under \"OAuth2 > URL Generator\":

   - Scopes: `bot`
   - Permissions:
     - `Manage Channels`
     - `Manage Webhooks`
     - `Send Messages`
     - `Read Message History`
     - `Attach Files`
   - Copy and open the generated URL to invite the bot to your server.

6. In Discord, create a **text channel** for tracking active sessions (e.g., `#active-sessions`). Copy its ID and put it in `.env` as `SESSIONS_CHANNEL_ID`.

7. Create a **Webhook** in a test channel and copy its URL into `.env` as `WEBHOOK_URL` for testing.
